React makes code
    1. Composable
    2. Declarative - You don't have explicitly say do this and that
React figures out how to do it.

const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.textContent = "This is an imperative way to do things"
h1.className = "header"
document.getElementById("root").append(h1)

(Better)
ReactDOM.render(<h1 className="header">Hello, React!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"))


 - With React, you are making your entire program in js.
